We identified 27 studies that assessed the effectiveness of social marketing on behavioral factors, behaviors, and health outcomes related to HIV.

- [20 studies]({{ relativepath }}{{ baseurl }}/hiv/hiv-behavioral_factors.html) found changes in **behavioral factors** such as increases in risk perception, knowledge, and self-efficacy about HIV/AIDS.

- [18 studies]({{ relativepath }}{{ baseurl }}/reproductive_health/reproductive_health-behaviors.html) found changes in **behaviors** such increases up to 100% in condom use, 49% reductions in needle sharing among people who inject drugs, and increases in HIV testing.  There were no significant effects for partner reduction.

- [8 studies]({{ relativepath }}{{ baseurl }}/reproductive_health/reproductive_health-health.html) found changes in **health outcomes** such as reductions of up to 53% in HIV prevalence and 77% in STI prevalence, and 79% increase in STI cure rate.

A total of 16 out of 27 HIV studies had Strength of the Evidence scores of 4 or higher and 15 studies had Social Marketing Benchmark Criteria scores of 5 or higher.
