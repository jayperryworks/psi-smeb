We identified 14 studies that assessed the effectiveness of social marketing on behavioral factors, behaviors, and health outcomes related to reproductive health.

* [10 studies]({{ relativepath }}{{ baseurl }}/reproductive_health/reproductive_health-behavioral_factors.html) found changes in **behavioral factors** such as positive changes in social norms and attitudes about modern contraception and family planning.

* [13 studies]({{ relativepath }}{{ baseurl }}/reproductive_health/reproductive_health-behaviors.html) found changes in **behaviors**, including up to 55% increase in modern contraceptive use. Additionally, there was evidence of improvements in service utilization and quality of care.

* [1 study]({{ relativepath }}{{ baseurl }}/reproductive_health/reproductive_health-health.html) evaluated **health outcomes**. The study found no difference in unplanned pregnancy rates between treatment and control.

A total of 9 reproductive health studies out of 14 had Strength of the Evidence scores of 4 or higher and 8 studies had Social Marketing Benchmark Criteria scores of 5 or higher.
