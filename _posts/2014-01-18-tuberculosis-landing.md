We identified 2 studies that assessed the effectiveness of social marketing on behaviors and health outcomes related to tuberculosis.

* [2 studies]({{ relativepath }}{{ baseurl }}/tuberculosis/tuberculosis-behaviors.html) found changes in **behaviors**, including up to 64% increase in TB smear testing.

* [1 study]({{ relativepath }}{{ baseurl }}/tuberculosis/tuberculosis-health.html) found changes in health outcomes. The study found a 50% increase in the TB case notification rate and a 52% increase in number of new cases of positive pulmonary TB.

One of the two tuberculosis studies had Strength of the Evidence scores of 4 or higher and both studies had Social Marketing Benchmark Criteria scores of 5 or higher.
