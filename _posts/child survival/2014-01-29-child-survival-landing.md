We identified 37 studies that assessed the effectiveness of social marketing on behavioral factors, behaviors, and health outcomes related to child survival.  Child survival interventions covered child nutrition, diarrheal disease, maternal and neonatal mortality, and pneumonia. 

- 21 studies found changes in behavioral factors such as improvements in knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about anemia, breastfeeding, water treatment, and delivery with a skilled birth attendant.  Evidence from these studies found improvements in purchasing and ownership of socially market products, such as micronutrient powders and water treatment products. We found:

  - [4 studies]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.categories | replace: ' ','-' | first }}//nutrition/behavioral-factors) on child nutrition
  - [9 studies]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.categories | replace: ' ','-' | first }}//diarrheal-disease/behavioral-factors) on  diarrheal diseases
  - [9 studies]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.categories | replace: ' ','-' | first }}//maternal-neonatal-mortality/behavioral-factors) on maternal neonatal mortality
  - 0 studies on pneumonia.

- 28 studies found changes in behaviors, including: increased breastfeeding and use of micronutrient powders and consumption of nutrient-rich and fortified foods to decrease undernutrition; use of iron folic acid supplements by women of reproductive age; and improved hygiene behaviors, including hand washing, and use of oral rehydration salts, zinc tablets, and water treatment products to decreases incidence of diarrheal and diarrheal-related morbidity and mortality. Studies found up to 25% increase in latrine use, 43% increase in chemically treating water. We found:

  - [5 studies]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.categories | replace: ' ','-' | first }}//nutrition/behaviors) on child nutrition
  - [16 studies]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.categories | replace: ' ','-' | first }}//diarrheal-disease/behaviors) on diarrheal diseases
  - [8 studies]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.categories | replace: ' ','-' | first }}//maternal-neonatal-mortality/behaviors) on maternal neonatal mortality
  - 0 studies on pneumonia.

- 11 studies found changes in health outcomes, such as statistically significant reductions in incidence of diarrheal disease and stunting among children under the age of five.  These studies found reductions in iron deficiency anemia and improvements in serum retinol levels among children and women of reproductive age, including pregnant women. We found:

  - [5 studies]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.categories | replace: ' ','-' | first }}//nutrition/health-outcomes) on child nutrition
  - [2 studies]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.categories | replace: ' ','-' | first }}//diarrheal-disease/health-outcomes) on  diarrheal diseases
  - [6 studies]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.categories | replace: ' ','-' | first }}//maternal-neonatal-mortality/health-outcomes) on maternal neonatal mortality
  - 0 studies on pneumonia.

A total of 27 child survival studies out of 37 had Strength of the Evidence scores of 4 or higher and 21 studies had Social Marketing Benchmark Criteria scores of 5 or higher.
