  <h2>What is Social Marketing?</h2>

  <p>A strategy that uses marketing concepts — product design, appropriate pricing, sales and distribution, and communications — to influence behaviors that benefit individuals and communities for the greater good.<a href="#ref-1" class="footnote">1</a> Social marketing programs sell subsidized products through commercial sector outlets like pharmacies, distribute products for free, deliver health services through social franchises, and promote behaviors not dependent upon a product or service, like hand washing.</p>

  <h2>What Does This Mean For You?</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Social marketing can make people healthier</li>
    <li>Successful social marketing programs seek insight into their consumers and the market and target segments of the population most likely to change</li>
    <li>Effective approaches, like condom social marketing and social franchising of health services, should be replicated and scaled up</li>
    <li>More social marketing evaluations are needed to fill gaps in the evidence</li>

  <h2>How Do We Know If Social Marketing Makes People Healthier?</h2>

  <p>In response to questions about the effectiveness of social marketing in global health, we systematically reviewed all literature published between 1995 and 2013 on social marketing for HIV, reproductive health, malaria, child survival, and tuberculosis in developing countries.<a href="#ref-2" class="footnote">2</a> After reviewing more than 6500 studies, we found 111 studies looking at whether social marketing makes people healthier. Here's what these studies tell us about what social marketing programs can achieve.</p>

  <section>

  <h3>Behavioral Determinants</h3>

  <ul class="behaviors">
    <li>
      <h4>HIV</h4>
      <p><strong>20 Studies:</strong> Increases in risk perception, knowledge, and self-efficacy about HIV/AIDS</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Reproductive Health</h4>
      <p><strong>10 Studies:</strong> Positive changes in social norms and attitudes about modern contraception and family planning</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Malaria</h4>
      <p><strong>X Studies:</strong> Increases in awareness of insecticide-treated bednets and net ownership. Free distribution outperforms social marketing on ownership</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Child Survival</h4>
      <p><strong>X Studies:</strong> Improvements in knowledge and attitudes about water treatment, zinc treatment, vitamin supplements, and food fortifications</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Behavior</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>HIV</h4>
        <p><strong>14 Studies:</strong> Up to 100% increase in HIV condom use, 49% reduction in needle sharing, and increase in HIV testing. No effects for partner reduction</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Reproductive Health</h4>
        <p><strong>13 Studies:</strong> Up to 55% increase RH in modern contraceptive use. Improvements in service utilization and quality of care</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Malaria</h4>
        <p><strong>X Studies:</strong> Increases in bednet and insecticide use and in initiation of anti-malarial treatment</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Child Survival</h4>
        <p><strong>X Studies:</strong> Increases in use of LD point-of-use water treatment IVAL products, zinc treatment, and fortification products</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Tuberculosis</h4>
        <p><strong>2 Studies:</strong> 64% increase in smear testing</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Health Outcomes</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>HIV</h4>
          <p><strong>8 Studies:</strong> Reductions of up HIV to 53% in HIV prevalence and 77% in STI prevalence, and 79% increase in STI cure rate</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Reproductive Health</h4>
          <p><strong>1 Study:</strong> No difference in unplanned pregnancy found between treatment and control</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Malaria</h4>
          <p><strong>X Studies:</strong> Positive changes in malaria incidence, prevalence, and cure rate</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Child Survival</h4>
          <p><strong>X Studies:</strong> Reductions in CHILD diarrheal incidence and
  ￼￼￼SURVIVAL undernutrition</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Tuberculosis</h4>
          <p><strong>1 Study:</strong> 50% increase in TB case notification rate, and 52% increase in number of new cases of positive pulmonary TB</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h2>The Social Marketing Evidence: Compiling The Data</h2>
  <p>The Social marketing Evidence Base is a resource that compiles evaluations of social marketing interventions by PSI, other NGOs, and academic institutions in the health areas where we work. To develop this resource, we completed these steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><h4><strong>6,532 Studies</strong> Gathered and Evaluated</h4></li>
    <li><h4>Through A Rigorous Eligibility Review Process <strong>111 Studies</strong> Showing Changes In Outcomes oltimately Included</h4></li>
    <li>
      <h4><strong>strength Of Evidence (SOE)</strong> grading Criteria Were Applied To Each Study</h4>

      <small>
        We used a <strong>Strength Of The Evidence (SoE)</strong><a href="#ref-2" class="footnote">2</a> grading criteria to score studies on measured outcomes, type of study design, population–representative sampling, data analysis, and whether it was peer-reviewed or grey literature. Based on these factors, studies were ranked on a <strong>scale from one to six</strong>, with six meaning greater validity of the findings.
      </small>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Each Eligible Study Was Then Assessed Using The <strong>8 Social Marketing Benchmark Criteria</strong></h4>

      <small>
        According to the <strong>Social Marketing Benchmark Criteria (SMBC)</strong>,<a href="#ref-3" class="footnote">3</a> a Social Marketing intervention is characterized by 8 qualities. Studies were graded on a <strong>scale from one to eight</strong>, with one point awarded for each characteristic present in a given program.
        <ul>
          <li>Theory</li>
          <li>Segmentation</li>
          <li>Competition</li>
          <li>Exchange</li>
          <li>Method Mix</li>
          <li>Customer Orientation</li>
          <li>Insight</li>
          <li>Behavior</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
