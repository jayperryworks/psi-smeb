We identified 2 studies that assessed the effectiveness of social marketing on behaviors and health outcomes related to tuberculosis.

- [1 study]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/tuberculosis/behaviors) found changes in behaviors, including up to 64% increase in sputum smear testing.

- [2 studies]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/tuberculosis/health-outcomes) found changes in health outcomes. One study found a 50% increase in TB case notification rate and one study found a 52% increase in new cases of smear positive pulmonary TB.

One of the two tuberculosis studies had Strength of the Evidence scores of 4 or higher and both studies had Social Marketing Benchmark Criteria scores of 5 or higher.
