We identified 29 studies that assessed the effectiveness of social marketing on behavioral factors, behaviors, and health outcomes related to malaria.

- [20 studies]({{ relativepath }}{{ baseurl }}/malaria/malaria-behavior_factors.html) found changes in **behavioral factors** such as improvements in knowledge of insecticide treated bednets and artemisinin-combination therapies (ACTs), and increased ownership of bednets. Bednet ownership was higher in interventions where there was social marketing plus free distribution of bednets compared to social marketing alone.

- [21 studies]({{ relativepath }}{{ baseurl }}/malaria/malaria-behaviors.html) found changes in **health behaviors** such as increased use of bednets by children under the age of five and pregnant women, treatment-seeking for fever, and use of ACTs. Studies found 15-40% increases for infant use of bednets and 20-40% increases for other populations. A limited number of studies found improvements in provider use of rapid diagnostic tests and ACTs.

- [10 studies]({{ relativepath }}{{ baseurl }}/malaria/malaria-health.html) found changes in **health outcomes** such as reduced prevalence of parasitemia and anemia, and increased child survival among children under the age of five.

A total of 20 malaria studies out of 29 had Strength of the Evidence scores of 4 or higher. Only 7 malaria studies had [Social Marketing Benchmark Criteria](http://www.thensmc.com/sites/default/files/benchmark-criteria-090910.pdf) scores of 5 or higher.
