PSI and other organizations use social marketing to prevent malaria and improve treatment of cases. The effectiveness of social marketing interventions in preventing and treating malaria in LMICs is documented in our Social Marketing Evidence Base.  The Social Marketing Evidence Base compiles systematically reviewed evaluations of social marketing and social franchising interventions by PSI and other organizations in the health areas where PSI operates.

We identified 28 studies that assessed the effectiveness of social marketing on behavioral factors, behaviors, and health outcomes related to malaria.

- 19 studies found changes in behavioral factors such as improvements in knowledge about insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), and increased ownership of ITNs. Ownership was higher in interventions where there was social marketing plus free distribution of ITNs compared to social marketing alone.

- 20 studies found changes in behaviors such as increased use of ITNs by children under the age of five and pregnant women, treatment-seeking for fever, and use of ACTs.  Additionally studies demonstrated improvements in provider use of rapid diagnostic test and ACTs.

- 10 studies found changes in health outcomes such as reduced prevalence of parasitemia and anemia, and increased child survival among children under the age of five.


For all eligible studies, we used strength of the evidence (SoE) grading criteria to score studies on measured outcomes, type of study design, population–representative sampling, data analysis, and whether the study was peer-reviewed or grey literature. Based on these factors, studies were ranked on a scale from one to six, with six signifying greater validity of the findings. A total of 19 malaria studies had SOE scores of 4 or higher. 

We also compared these social marketing interventions against the National Social Marketing Center’s eight Social Marketing Benchmark Criteria (SMBC)—behavior, customer orientation, theory, insight, exchange, competition, segmentation, and methods mix. Only 7 malaria studies had SMBC scores of 5 or higher.
