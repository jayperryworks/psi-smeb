latrine (49% of visits vs. 27%)","On multivariate analysis, chlorinating stored water [relative risk (RR)0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28–0.69], latrine presence (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.54–0.92), rainwater use (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52–0.95), and living in an intervention village (RR 0.31, 95%CI 0.23–0.41), were independently associated with lower diarrhoea risk",Quasi-experimental,Probability,5,"4: Behavior, Exchange, Insight, Methods mix"
