17% of individuals in non-intervention areas reported having had a biological diagnosis for their most recent episode of illness. This was significantly higher in the areas with VMWs (63%) and outreach (35%);  VMWs and outreach workers reported always using RDTs. In contrast, only 15%  of tests at
private health facilities and 69%  public health facilities were by RDT; VMW scheme and outreach significantly increased the likelihood of being seen by a trained provider (Adjusted
Odds Ratios (AOR) of 148 and 4 respectively) and of receiving A+M (AORs of 2.7 and 7.7 respectively).</td>
